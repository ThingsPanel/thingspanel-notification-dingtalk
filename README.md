# ThingsPanel notification plugin: DingTalk group robot

DingTalk custom group robot only. Target and signing secret are instance configuration; no delivery receipt is claimed.

This is an independent Go module for the frozen ThingsPanel notification plugin HTTP v1 contract. It includes the provider adapter, executable, tests, and a source snapshot of the portable SDK so it builds without Encore/Core imports or external Go dependencies. SDK source is maintained at [thingspanel-notification-plugin-sdk](https://github.com/ThingsPanel/thingspanel-notification-plugin-sdk); compare snapshots when upgrading.

## Build and test

```sh
GOPROXY=off GOSUMDB=off go test ./...
GOPROXY=off GOSUMDB=off go vet ./...
GOPROXY=off GOSUMDB=off go build ./cmd/plugin
```

Tests use local fixtures only. Running the executable does not authorize or perform a real provider send. Do not put credentials in source control or logs. `accepted` means provider submission acceptance, not delivery; uncertain outcomes are not automatically retried.
